Thank you for considering contributing to TiLiA! I really believe that, with the help of an active community, this software might significantly change the way we study, understand and write about music, cinema and other topics related to audio and video.

# Where to contribute
Help is appreciated is every front. Feel free to make PR or to contact me to discuss contributing.

Apart from coding proper, contributions would be appreciated in:

## Automated testing
Testing guidelines can be found [here](./TESTING.md).

## Tutorials/guides:
The program should be fairly intuitive for the users, but tutorials and guides will need to be done at some point, as they will significantly facilitate the adoption by new users. They can be either written or in video form, ideally both. [This video](https://vimeo.com/767282249) serves as rough general quickstart guide, for now.

## Documentation:
The documentation is almost non-existent at the moment. Docstrings for functions and modules need to start being inserted soon.

## Making annotations using TiLiA
With the new platform in the making (https://tilia-ad98d.web.app/), it is possible to share TiLiA files publicly. Increasing the amount of available files would be of great help.

## Reporting bugs
If you find a bug, [check](https://github.com/FelipeDefensor/TiLiA/issues) if there isn't an open issue reporting it, if not, please [open a new one](https://github.com/FelipeDefensor/TiLiA/issues/new). The following information might be helpful:

- Your operating system;
- TiLiA version (can be found in the Help > About menu);
- Description of the issue;
- Steps to reproduce it.

# Suggesting features or enhancements
We are very much looking for ideas of new features for TiLiA. If you would like to suggest one, [check](https://github.com/FelipeDefensor/TiLiA/issues) if there isn't an issue requesting. If not, [open a new one](https://github.com/FelipeDefensor/TiLiA/issues/new) detailing your suggestion.

You need Python 3.11 to build and test TiLiA. You will also need to have ffmpeg installed to use the export and convert audio features.
